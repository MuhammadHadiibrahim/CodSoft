            <h1>Introduction</h1>

            <h2>Hazrat Muhammad (pbuh)</h2>

            <p>
                Muhammad was born in approximately 570 CE in Mecca. He was the son of Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib and Amina bint Wahb. His father, Abdullah, the son of Quraysh tribal leader Abd al-Muttalib ibn Hashim, died a few months before Muhammad's birth. His mother Amina died when he was six, leaving Muhammad an orphan. He was raised under the care of his grandfather, Abd al-Muttalib, and paternal uncle, Abu Talib. In later years, he would periodically seclude himself in a mountain cave named Hira for several nights of prayer. When he was 40, circa 610 CE, Muhammad reported being visited by Gabriel in the cave and receiving his first revelation from God. In 613, Muhammad started preaching these revelations publicly, proclaiming that "God is One", that complete "submission" (islām) to God (Allah) is the right way of life (dīn), and that he was a prophet and messenger of God, similar to the other prophets in Islam. <br>
                According to various sources, including Sahih al-Bukhari, Muhammad said that he felt his aorta being severed because of the food he ate at Khaybar. On 8 June 632, Muhammad died. In his last moments, he reportedly uttered:
                O God, forgive me and have mercy on me; and let me join the highest companions. <br>—Muhammad

    <h1>Biography of Holy Prophet Hazrat Muhammad</h1>
 </div>
        <div class="para-content">
            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Hazrat Muhammad (peace be upon him) is revered as the last prophet and messenger of Islam. Born in Mecca around 570 CE, he grew up as an orphan under the care of his grandfather and later his uncle. Muhammad, even before his prophethood, was known for his integrity, honesty, and trustworthiness, earning him the title of Al-Amin (The Trustworthy) among his peers.</p>
                <h1>First Revelation</h1>
              <p>  At the age of 40, during one of his contemplative retreats in the Cave of Hira, he received the first revelation from Allah (God) through the Angel Gabriel. These revelations, spanning over 23 years, would later form the basis of the Quran, the holy book of Islam. <br>
                
                Despite facing immense opposition and persecution from the Quraysh tribe, Muhammad continued to spread the message of monotheism and social justice. His teachings emphasized compassion, equality, and the importance of moral conduct in personal and societal affairs.
                <h1>Migration</h1>
                <p> In 622 CE, faced with increasing hostility, Muhammad migrated to Medina, an event known as the Hijra, which marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar. In Medina, he established a cohesive community based on justice, mutual respect, and cooperation among its diverse inhabitants. <br>
                
                Throughout his life, Muhammad exemplified humility, patience, and forgiveness, even in the face of adversity. He led by example, promoting peace and reconciliation, while also defending the community when necessary. <br>
                <h1>Conquest of Mecca</h1>
               <p> Muhammad's prophethood culminated in the conquest of Mecca in 630 CE, where he forgave his former enemies and granted amnesty to the city. He continued to spread the message of Islam until his passing in 632 CE in Medina. <br>
                
                Hazrat Muhammad's life serves as a timeless model of righteousness, compassion, and devotion to God. His legacy continues to inspire millions of Muslims worldwide, guiding them towards a life of faith, righteousness, and service to humanity.</p> <br>
                <h1>Death and tomb :</h1>
               <p> According to various sources, including Sahih al-Bukhari, Muhammad said that he felt his aorta being severed because of the food he ate at Khaybar. On 8 June 632, Muhammad died. In his last moments, he reportedly uttered: <br>
                O God, forgive me and have mercy on me; and let me join the highest companions. <br>—Muhammad</p>
